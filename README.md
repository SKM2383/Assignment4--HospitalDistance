# Assignment4--HospitalDistance

Upgrade assignment 3 Hospital List application to return the list of hospital nearby you using the following algorithms:

1.       Compare the distance between search key (geolocation) and each hospital coordinate and return the closet hospital nearby you based on the distance formula (Haversine).

2.       Add radius parameter to allow the user to set the radius of the hospital nearby in miles. Use the difference distances from your location to hospital nearby within the specified radius to create a min-heap.

3.       Display the list of hospitals with in the specified radius ordered by the distance that is closer to user location from min-heap.

4.       Use the hospital list data to construct your own graph to apply shortest path algorithm.
